## Summary

Backend developer focused on practical architecture and production-grade reliability.  
I build microservices in Java using Spring Boot, with asynchronous communication via Kafka and RabbitMQ.  
I care about secure APIs (JWT, access control), data consistency (SAGA pattern), and keeping systems predictable and testable.  
I prefer clean architecture and clear separation of concerns between components.
